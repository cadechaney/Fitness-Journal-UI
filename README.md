# Front End for SweatScript

# Main Idea for the Project:

As an athlete I have always written down on paper my workout to track my growth. Now with this fullstack application anyone is able to 
title, date and add description to all their workouts.

# Challenges

The biggest challenge I had with this project was handling data I was getting from my backend

# Wins

This is my first fullstack project, so exploring working with both sides was a great experience

# Future Feature Ideas:

Creating another outside database to send in workout information the user can use to build their workouts.
Adding a social media aspect to become friends with and share workouts.
